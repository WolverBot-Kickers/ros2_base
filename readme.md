# ROS2 Template Repository

This is a ROS2 Template Repository. This comes with the necessary dockerfile and setups that comes with:

- ROS2 Jazzy
- Turtlesim (examples)
- noVNC (if you've taken EECS 388, this is what they use for docker GUIs as well)

### Getting Started

Ensure that you have Docker installed.

Run 

```
docker compose up -d
```

To build and run the containers. 

### Running GUI Applications

This branch uses noVNC. 

All GUI output will be redirected to `localhost:8080/vnc.html`.

### Trobleshooting

Reach out to any of the leads or Shin for any questions.
